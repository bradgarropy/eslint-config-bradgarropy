# 💎 eslint-config-bradgarropy

My personal [eslint][1] configuration.

### 📦 Installation

This package is hosted on [npm][2].  

Install the configuration and it's peer dependencies as a development dependency.

```
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-bradgarropy
```

> This installs peer dependencies automatically using [npx][3] and [install-peerdeps][4] so you don't have to!

### ⚙ Usage

Create an `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project and tell it to extend the configuration.

```
{
    extends: "bradgarropy"
}
```

> You can add more ESLint configuration options in this file if you want.

### ❔ Questions

If you have any trouble, definitely [open an issue][5] and I'll take a look.

Or you can consult the [ESLint Shareable Configs documentation][6].

And if all else fails, you can ask me directly on [Twitter][7] or my [AMA][8].
